FTrack Approval Status Listener
==============================================

This ftrack plugin listens for when task/asset versions are updated to be approved and prompts for a description when 
it is missing.

Installation:

Download and run ftrack-connect on your mac. When it's running on your activity bar - you should be able to
"open plugin directory" to find the location where this directory and it's contents should be put. Once you've done 
that, restart connect and the plugin should be running.

More detailed detailed installation instructions (including other platforms) are available on here:
